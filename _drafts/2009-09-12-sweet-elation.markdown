oh sweet caffeine

take me to a heightened alertness

remove my fear of narcolepsy

be my wingman for my commute

love me like no other can  

it pains me that for us to be together, 
i must  

roast you.grind you.boil you.press you.and

consume you  


but it must be, for our souls to be entwined

our essence combined  

oh nectar of the gods  

you complete me
