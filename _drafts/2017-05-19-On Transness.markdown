tl;dr : You.  Do.  You.  

I accepted that I am transgender last spring, almost one year ago to the day of this writing.  It was a whirlwind of self-discovery, and a wild ride of introspection and panic. Of course, I always knew that I was trans, and my earliest memory of desiring girlhood was probably about 5 years old.  But denial is a real prick. 

Once I discovered this internal denial, I wasted no time.  A combination of luck, privilege, and sheer willpower, and I had a top-notch therapist, a wonderfully compassionate physician, and a jug of hormones in my hand.  Within weeks, the physical changes and emotional changes were like the best anti-depressants I could have ever asked for; within months, my body and face were closer and closer to what my brain had been expecting all along.  It was getting better and better.  


But I wasn't wearing makeup.  I wasn't wearing heels.  I wasn't wearing a dress. 

I was wearing jeans, a tshirt, a sports bra, and sneakers.  

Another transgender girl in the area seemed to be confused by this.  Her perspective was that there was no point to transitioning genders if I wasn't going to go full hard femme.  This was very apparent with her question "When do I get to meet Daphne?", as if transitioning meant that I would become a completely different person.  I've always been Daphne, and always will be. 

My partner was similarly inquisitive, and asked why I would go through all of the hardships of a social transition, just to change my name and gender marker.  

I think this outlines the very gender binary that I felt a need to escape; if you're not 100% male, you must be 100% female.  Early on, my knowledge of transgender folks was minimal, and when I tried to fit my own idea of my own gender into this model, it didn't work.  So I must not be transgender then, right?  This way of thinking further closeted me, and I ended up taking years longer to realize and come out.  Had I known early on that I could exist on a spectrum, I would have allowed myself.  

However well intentioned and free this spectrum was intended to be, it also serves to provide a grounds for competition between trans folk.  Who passes better; who is more trans.  This can then quickly become a pissing contest where folks who are on HRT feel superior to those who can't afford it, and those who blend in with cis people feel superior to those who get clocked.  This infighting creates animosity in a community that needs unity and strength.  Again, this is because the spectrum is treated not as a place to exist, but as a progress indicator of how far you've progressed in the binary gender model.  

You may one day find me in heels and a dress, perhaps at a wedding, or formal social event.  I'm sure I'll have fun doing it too.  But until that day, I'll wear my faded deadmau5 T-shirt, my old boy jeans, and my sneakers.
