A few pots of coffee later, and I'm finally rolling with Jekyll.  Coming from Octopress should have made this an easy transition, but it was not for me.  I suppose I could have just started by reading the docs, but I jumped in thinking I would completely understand the framework. 

No matter!  Here we are.  

**Why I chose Jekyll** 
 - Static HTML/CSS (*security*)
 - I need more Ruby in my life
 - Fuck Wordpress
 - Markdown is wonderful
