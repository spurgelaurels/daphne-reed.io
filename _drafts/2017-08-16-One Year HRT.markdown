It was one year ago today, that I sat in my doctor's office, after months of discussions, bloodtests, anxiety, and hope. She wrote out a little scrip, I calmly thanked her, and I took it to a pharmacist, where I handed it over. I expected the world to end at that very moment, but instead she said "come back in an hour". I was back in 59 minutes.


As a child, I would often find myself daydreaming of a magic spell, or a pill that would swap my gender from this ill fitting, disassociated, and admittedly awkward male body, to one that my brain seemed to be expecting from the moment I could say the words "boy" or "girl".


And here I was, holding those very fucking pills in my own fucking hand, at 34 years old. And I devoured them.


One year it's been now, and there hasn't been a single day that I've regretted that decision. Sure, I've taken on heaps of sexism, trans/misogyny, and a lot of my friendships and relationships have changed. But I've gained many new friends, many new insights, and most importantly, the ability to look fear right in its childish little face, and have the strength to give it the hug it needs to find joy in life.
