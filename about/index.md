Trans/fem hacker from Hamilton, Ontario.  

I play jazz piano, and enjoy twisting theory around in an eclectic manner.

I work in network and information security, intersecting DevOps.  

I'm a shitty vegan, although I try.  A few beers in me and I find a plate of chicken wings, or a hamburger in my face pretty fast.  

I drink way too much coffee, and not enough green tea.  

If it's nice outside, I want to be on my bike.  I own multiple bikes, and kind of want a few more. 

I have a modular synth, and I kind of want a few more.  

I produce music with the aforementioned modular, in conjunction with various other synths, drum machines, and outboard gear.  
I have G.A.S in a bad way.  

I'm the parent of two wonderful children, and they've renewed my sense of urgency when it comes to environmental and political issues.  
I want them to inherit a world with less hate, pollution, and political nonsense than I was handed.  

Intersectional feminist, atheist(ish), online rights activist, socialist green (mild-)anarchist pacifist.  That's enough ist in my list.  


Blog posts will mostly be about the above.
