I recently came across a shared social media post concerning the removal of Lou Reed's Walk On The Wild Side from a playlist, based on the perception that the lyrical content contained transphobic ideals.


I am a transgender woman. I can tell you about transphobia, and what it looks like.


Lou Reed's song is in no way transphobic. It merely mentions a story about a transition, and how this person moved to a better life in an accepting community. Lou even uses the appropriate pronouns.


This is not transphobia, this is representation. I would be interested to hold a dialog with those offended by this song, to understand how, and why they were offended. I would also be interested to know if those offended were transgender themselves, or merely being offended on behalf of transgender people. Because in the case of the latter, I would be highly offended to know that someone is being offended on my behalf, and using my identity as a way to censor historically important art and culture. To me, this would be highly insulting.


I believe it is important to hold a dialog when someone is offended by something, however a knee-jerk reaction to censor oppositional criticism, or in this case, art and culture, is not the society I wish to live in. You may find, and I predict you will, that your actions to censor and remove this song will erode public trust in your organization. As community leaders, there is no greater damage. I wish to proffer a solution, and would suggest that perhaps a larger and more inclusive process would be in order; engage with local queer community leaders and members, and ask them. Speak to transgender people, with transgender living experience. In the case of racism, or religion, or classism, speak to members of those communities directly.


Sometimes it's okay to edify people that have been offended, and point out that they're ignorant to the actual message behind the words.

Sincerely,


Daphne Reed.
