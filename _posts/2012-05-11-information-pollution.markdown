"So, please tell me your idea again" said Jane, the venture capitalist.

"Well, people use the internet to search for information; you know, like recipes and shit.  Well, what if we created a web page that contained every single one of those search terms, and had computer generated text disguised as blog entries down the middle? This way, no matter what someone searched for, it would somehow link them to this page and they would be forced to read 3 paragraphs before realizing that they were reading gibberish!" replied Bill. 

"So you've got their attention.  Now what?" she asked.

"You're an asshole"
