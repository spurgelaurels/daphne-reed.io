Recently, I sent an email to the whole of my company, stating my intent to transition genders in the workplace.  This is the email:




Hello friends, extended family, and fellow Vidyardians. 

I have a matter of great import to impart upon you, and while I am known for my merry pranks and bouts of tomfoolery, I assure you that this is no prank. 

I found out in spring of 2016 that I am transgender (although, I really have known this since childhood).  This essentially means that my unconscious gender and my expressed (or conscious) gender do not align.  I spent several months with a gender therapist and my doctor, mostly trying to reason my way out of it, or find a way to be happy in my assigned gender (male).  But in the end, we decided to move towards hormone replacement therapy in August of last year.  The impact was almost immediate, and it was immensely positive.  As such, I regret to inform you that my legacy of being Angry Linux Guy is over, and we now enter the era of Pretty-Happy Linux Chick. 

To elaborate further, I have decided to continue hormone therapy, and move towards a full social transition.  Some of you may have noticed that some changes have already been happening, and over the next few months, many more changes will follow.  These include both physical changes, as well as changes to my attire and presentation.  I'm a practical person, so you will not see much beyond jeans, sneakers, and a snarky T-shirt.  (Although if I find a cute skater dress that has pockets and prints of Tux, the Linux penguin all over it, I reserve the right to wear said skater dress and look totes-adorbz). 

This also means that my modes of address (name and gender pronouns) will change.  Presently, my full name is David Robert John Reed, and I will be applying for a legal name change to Daphne Lydia Reed; Daphne being the female equivalent to David.  There's a lovely backstory about both names that I'm willing to share with anyone who asks. 
My pronouns will also change to she/her.   Many of you have affectionately referred to me as DaveOps for a long time, in fact this nickname was coined during my hiring interview phase!  This can conveniently be replaced with DaphOps, D-Ops, DaphnOps, to taste. 
Also at this time, I will change my designated bathroom as appropriate with my new gender. 

I am planning for a transition on July 29th, which is my 35th birthday (I know, I don't look a day over 25!).  After this time, I will no longer be presenting boymode, and will begin presenting in girlmode.  Chances are, you won't notice a thing, and I hope that you don't.  But it will be at this time that I will begin politely correcting the use of any incorrect terms, names, or pronouns.  For the first while, I will respond to, and respect the use of both names, and both sets of pronouns.  You will, of course, obtain bonus points for early adoption. 

Beyond a naming and pronoun change in late July/August, I would hope that our daily interactions do not change, and that everything continues just as it always has. 

If you have any questions, comments, positive feedback or messages, please feel free to message me on Slack, or email me.  I have been obsessively researching and educating myself on this subject for the last 16 months, and now possess a wealth of knowledge on this matter;  I am very open to sharing.  I have also included some links to further reading on this subject, if you prefer to self-edify.  You will find them below.


My sincere apologies to those who are surprised by this news, or offended by learning about this through a company wide email.  My initial intent was to tell everyone in small groups, or one-on-one.  I was able to tell approximately 40 people in this manner, but it proved to be far too emotionally draining to me, and I've opted to share this in a team email. 


I want to thank everyone who has already shared their positive feedback with me.  I am overwhelmed with joy every single time someone joins me on this journey.  


Much love,

Daphne Lydia Reed
